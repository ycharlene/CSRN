    Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE).

    CVE decouples visual features into target and low information regions,
    identifies dominant tokens, and dynamically suppresses their representations
    to enhance discriminative visual features.

    The key insight is that the CLS token may be dominated by a few patches
    with high attention weights, which can suppress other discriminative features.
    CVE addresses this by:
    1. Identifying dominant patches via attention threshold
    2. Extracting contextual information from non-dominant patches
    3. Enhancing CLS representation with filtered contextual features
